This is my first Solo project and I decided to make a Library Managment system that will work flawlessly in a professional setting.It will be very easy to follow and understand as you go through the project. The users of this software will be regular library members/customers and administrators for the Library. I hav always been fond of the library and their entire system, and wanted to try and mimic it. I believe people would like to use my software over existing software because of how simple and effective it is.
